# Prescription Payment Flow Fix - Two-Step Submission

**Date: January 19, 2026**
**Status: COMPLETE ✅**

---

## Problem

The prescription was being submitted to the pharmacy (DigitalRx) **BEFORE** the patient paid. This is wrong because:

1. Provider creates prescription → Immediately sent to pharmacy → Status: "Submitted"
2. Patient receives payment link
3. Patient pays (maybe... maybe not)
4. **Pharmacy already has the order even if patient never pays!**

**This is a major issue** - we're sending orders to the pharmacy without confirming payment first.

---

## Solution: Two-Step Process

### NEW FLOW (Correct):

#### **Step 1: Create Prescription (Payment Required)**
- Provider creates prescription with patient price
- Prescription saved with status: **"pending_payment"**
- Payment status: **"pending"**
- **NOT submitted to pharmacy yet**
- Patient receives payment link via email

#### **Step 2: After Payment Received**
- Patient pays via payment link
- Authorize.Net webhook confirms payment
- Webhook calls new API: `/api/prescriptions/[id]/submit-to-pharmacy`
- **NOW** prescription is submitted to DigitalRx
- Status changes to: **"submitted"**
- Payment status: **"paid"**
- Queue ID received from pharmacy

## Files Modified

### 1. **`app/api/prescriptions/submit/route.ts`** ✅

**Changes:**
- Added payment check: `requiresPayment` logic
- If patient_price > 0 → Save as "pending_payment" and DON'T submit to pharmacy
- If patient_price = 0 or no price → Submit immediately to pharmacy
- Return different messages based on payment requirement

**Key Code:**
```typescript
const requiresPayment = body.patient_price && parseFloat(body.patient_price) > 0;
let prescriptionStatus = "pending_payment"; // Default when payment required

if (!requiresPayment) {
  // Submit to DigitalRx immediately
  prescriptionStatus = "submitted";
} else {
  // Save as pending_payment, wait for payment
  console.log("💳 Payment required - saving as 'pending_payment'");
}
```

### 2. **`app/api/prescriptions/[id]/submit-to-pharmacy/route.ts`** ✅ (NEW FILE)

**Purpose:** Submit prescription to pharmacy AFTER payment is received

**Features:**
- Called by webhook after payment confirmation
- Checks if prescription is already submitted (idempotent)
- Verifies payment status is "paid"
- Submits to DigitalRx API
- Updates prescription with queue_id and status "submitted"
- Logs to system_logs

**Key Code:**
```typescript
// Check if payment is completed
if (prescription.payment_status !== "paid") {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { success: false, error: "Payment not completed" },
    { status: 400 }
  );
}

// Submit to DigitalRx...
// Update prescription status to "submitted"
```

### 3. **`app/api/webhooks/authnet/route.ts`** ✅

**Changes:**
- After payment success, calls the new submit-to-pharmacy endpoint
- Automatically submits prescription to pharmacy when payment is confirmed

**Key Code:**
```typescript
// Submit prescription to pharmacy now that payment is received
const submitResponse = await fetch(
  `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/prescriptions/${paymentTransaction.prescription_id}/submit-to-pharmacy`,
  { method: "POST" }
);
```

```
