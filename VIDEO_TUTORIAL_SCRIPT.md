## PRE-ROLL (10 seconds)

## SCENE 1: Your Invitation Email (30 seconds)

**[SCREEN]:** Show an example provider invitation email in an email client

"When an administrator invites you to RX Portal Pro, you'll receive an email invitation with a secure signup link. This link will take you to a registration page where you'll create your account password.

The invitation email will also show your assigned tier level — Tier 1 through Tier 4. Your tier determines the discount rates your patients receive on prescriptions. Higher tiers mean better pricing for your patients."

**Option 2: Send Payment Link** — If you prefer, you can send a secure payment link to your patient's email. They'll receive a link to a secure payment page where they can enter their card information at their convenience. Once they pay, the prescription is automatically submitted to the pharmacy."

**[ACTION]:** If demonstrating Option 1, show the card input fields

**[NARRATOR]:**

## SCENE 9: Understanding Prescription Status Flow (1 minute)

**[SCREEN]:** Show a prescription detail view with status timeline

**[NARRATOR]:**
"Let's understand how prescriptions move through the system. Every prescription goes through several stages:

**Stage 1: Pending Payment** — The prescription is created, but payment hasn't been received yet. If you sent a payment link, your patient needs to complete payment before it moves forward.

**Stage 2: Paid** — Payment has been processed successfully.

**Stage 3: Submitted** — The prescription has been sent to the pharmacy and accepted. You'll receive a Queue ID at this stage.

**Stage 4: In Progress** — The pharmacy is filling the prescription. This includes billing insurance (if applicable), packing the medication, and preparing for shipment.

**Stage 5: Shipped** — The package has been handed to the carrier (FedEx, UPS, etc.). You'll see a tracking number at this stage.

**Stage 6: Delivered** — The patient has received their medication. You'll see the delivery date and timestamp.

You and your patient receive email notifications at each major milestone, so everyone stays informed."

Your dashboard always displays your account information for quick reference when reaching out for support."

**[SCREEN]:** Return to the dashboard or prescription creation flow

**Tip 2:** Keep patient records updated. Accurate contact information ensures your patients receive payment links and prescription notifications.

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Recommended Recording Tools:
- **Screen recording:** Loom, OBS Studio, Camtasia, or ScreenFlow
- **Voiceover recording:** Blue Yeti or Rode NT-USB microphone for professional audio quality
- **Video editing:** DaVinci Resolve (free), Adobe Premiere Pro, or Final Cut Pro
- **AI Video Tools:** Synthesia, HeyGen, or D-ID for AI-generated presenter (if no live voiceover)

### Recording Setup:

### Voiceover Style:
- Professional, warm, and reassuring tone (healthcare providers appreciate confidence)
- Medium pace — not rushed, giving time to follow along
- Pause 1-2 seconds between sections to let viewers absorb information
- Emphasize key phrases like "Queue ID," "Tier level," "SIG instructions"

### Visual Tips:
- **Cursor highlighting:** Use a subtle highlight or zoom effect when clicking buttons
- **Callout boxes:** Add arrows or boxes to draw attention to important fields
- **Chapter markers:** Add timestamps in the video player for easy navigation
- **Text overlays:** Consider adding on-screen text for key terms (e.g., "Queue ID = Tracking Reference")

## ALTERNATE VERSION: AI-Generated Presenter Video

If using AI video tools like **Synthesia** or **HeyGen**, consider these adjustments:

### AI Presenter Setup:
- Choose a professional-looking avatar in medical attire (white coat or business casual)
- Use a clean, medical office background or a blurred healthcare setting
- Select a friendly, trustworthy voice (mid-30s to 40s age range works well for healthcare)

### Script Adjustments for AI Video:
- Add natural pauses and emphasis markers in the script
- Break long sentences into shorter, more conversational phrases
- Include gestures like pointing or nodding at key moments (if the AI tool supports it)

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended):
- Use AI presenter for intro/outro and narration
- Use screen recordings for the actual platform walkthrough
- Combine both in post-production for a polished, professional result

This approach balances cost-effectiveness with professional quality, especially if you don't have access to a live presenter or professional studio.
