# 📧 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT REQUEST - RX PORTAL PRO

**To:** Specode Technical Team
**From:** RX Portal Pro Client
**Subject:** URGENT - Production Deployment Request with Recent Updates
**Project URL:** https://app.specode.ai/project/rx-portal-pro-101
**Date:** January 9, 2026

---

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We have completed significant updates to the RX Portal Pro application over the past 5 days and are ready for **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**. This email outlines all changes, migration requirements, testing procedures, and critical items that need your team's attention.

**Total Changes:** 12 files modified, 4 API endpoints updated, 3 database migrations required

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

### **1. DATABASE MIGRATIONS** ⚠️ CRITICAL

Before deploying the code, you **MUST** run these 3 database migrations in order:

```bash
# Run in production database (Supabase)
# Location: /drizzle/migrations/

1. 20260109000003_aggressive_schema_reload.sql
2. 20260109000004_test_update_aimrx_pricing.sql
3. 20260109000005_insert_medication_function.sql
```

**These migrations handle:**
- Schema cache refresh for new pricing fields
- Testing update functionality for dual pricing
- Database function for medication insertion

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Do NOT skip these migrations or deployment will fail!

---

### **2. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES** ✅ VERIFY

Please verify these environment variables are set in production:

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL=<your-supabase-database-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-service-role-key>

# Email Service (Critical for prescription receipts)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<your-sendgrid-api-key>
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=<verified-sender-email>

# DigitalRx API (External Pharmacy Integration)
DIGITALRX_API_KEY=<your-digitalrx-api-key>

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

**⚠️ NEW:** The prescription receipt email now includes pricing/oversight fees. If SENDGRID_API_KEY is not set, prescription emails will fail silently.

## 🔧 MAJOR FEATURES DEPLOYED

### **Feature 1: Multiple Oversight & Monitoring Fees**
**What:** Providers can now add multiple oversight fees per prescription (not just one)

**Files Changed:**
- `app/(features)/prescriptions/new/step2/page.tsx`
- `app/(features)/prescriptions/new/step3/page.tsx`

**Testing Required:**
1. Create new prescription
2. Click "+ Add Fee" button multiple times
3. Add 3-5 different oversight fees with different reasons
4. Verify all fees display on Step 3 review page
5. Verify total calculations are correct
6. Submit prescription and verify success

**Expected Behavior:**
- Each fee has amount + reason dropdown
- 5 reason options available: Dose Titration, Side Effect Monitoring, Therapeutic Response, Adherence Tracking, Contraindication Screening
- Review page shows all individual fees + total oversight fees + grand total

---

### **Feature 2: Dual Pricing System (Wholesale vs Retail)**
**What:** Medications now have two separate pricing fields

**Pricing Fields:**
1. **Pricing to AIMRx** (`retail_price_cents`) - What pharmacy charges AIMRx
2. **AIMRx Site Pricing** (`notes` field) - What patients see on platform

**Files Changed:**
- `app/api/admin/medications/bulk-upload/route.ts`
- `app/(features)/admin/medications/bulk-upload/page.tsx`
- `app/api/provider/pharmacy/route.ts`

**Testing Required:**
1. Download CSV template from bulk upload page
2. Verify CSV has both pricing columns: `retail_price_cents` AND `aimrx_site_pricing_cents`
3. Upload CSV with 10+ medications including both pricing fields
4. Verify medications saved with both prices
5. View medication in catalog - should show both pricing fields
6. Create prescription - should show correct patient-facing price (AIMRx Site Pricing)

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** The `aimrx_site_pricing_cents` is stored in the `notes` field due to Supabase schema cache issues. This is a temporary workaround.

---

### **Feature 3: Medication Edit Functionality**
**What:** Blue pencil icon button allows editing medications after bulk upload

**Files Changed:**
- `app/(features)/admin/medication-catalog/page.tsx`
- `app/api/admin/medications/[id]/route.ts`

**Testing Required:**
1. Navigate to Medication Catalog
2. Click blue pencil (✏️) icon next to any medication
3. Edit modal should open with ALL fields populated
4. Change medication name, pricing, stock status, descriptions
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Verify success message appears
7. Verify table refreshes with updated data
8. Verify changes persisted (refresh page)

**Permissions:**
- **Pharmacy Admin:** Can only edit medications from their own pharmacy
- **Platform Admin:** Can edit ANY medication from any pharmacy

---

### **Feature 4: Provider Profile Simplification**
**What:** Removed entire Payment & Banking section, kept only Tax ID

**Files Changed:**
- `features/provider-profile/components/profile/AddressSection.tsx`

**Testing Required:**
1. Login as provider
2. Navigate to Provider Profile → Address & Billing section
3. Verify you see: Physical Address, Billing Address, Tax ID/EIN
4. Verify you DO NOT see: Bank Account, Routing Number, Payment Method, Payment Schedule, SWIFT Code
5. Edit Tax ID field and save
6. Verify Tax ID saves successfully

**Removed Fields:**
- ❌ Payment Method
- ❌ Payment Schedule
- ❌ Bank Account Number
- ❌ Routing Number
- ❌ Account Type
- ❌ SWIFT Code

**Kept Fields:**
- ✅ Tax ID / EIN

---

### **Feature 5: Optional Provider Profile Check**
**What:** Provider profile completion is no longer required to submit prescriptions

**Files Changed:**
- `app/api/prescriptions/submit/route.ts`

**Testing Required:**
1. Login as provider WITHOUT complete profile (missing payment/address info)
2. Create new prescription
3. Fill all prescription fields
4. Submit prescription
5. Should succeed (no longer blocked by incomplete profile)
6. Check server logs - should show warnings but not errors

**Expected Behavior:**
- Warnings logged to console if profile incomplete
- Prescription submission continues regardless
- No blocking error for incomplete profiles

---

### **Feature 6: Platform Admin Medication Permissions**
**What:** Platform admins can now edit medications from ANY pharmacy

**Files Changed:**
- `app/api/admin/medications/[id]/route.ts`

**Testing Required:**
1. Login as platform admin (NOT pharmacy admin)
2. Navigate to Medication Catalog
3. Verify you see medications from ALL pharmacies
4. Click edit (✏️) on medication from ANY pharmacy
5. Make changes and save
6. Should succeed regardless of which pharmacy owns the medication

---

### **⭐ Feature 7: UPDATED PRESCRIPTION RECEIPT EMAIL** ⚠️ CRITICAL

**What:** Email template now includes pricing and all oversight fees

**Files Changed:**
- `core/email/templates/prescription-receipt.tsx`

**New Email Sections:**
1. ✅ Price of Medication (green box with medication cost)
2. ✅ Medication Oversight & Monitoring Fees (ALL fees with reasons in blue boxes)
3. ✅ Total Oversight Fees (sum of all fees)
4. ✅ Total Patient Cost (medication + all fees in large gradient box)

**Testing Required:**
1. Create prescription with medication price + 2-3 oversight fees
2. Submit prescription successfully
3. Check email sent to patient
4. Verify email contains:
   - Price of Medication: $XX.XX
   - Each oversight fee with reason and amount
   - Total Oversight Fees: $XX.XX
   - Total Patient Cost: $XX.XX
5. Verify all calculations are correct
6. Test email rendering in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail
7. Test mobile email view

**⚠️ CRITICAL EMAIL INTEGRATION NEEDED:**

The email template is updated, but you need to ensure the prescription submission API passes these new fields when sending the email:

```typescript
// When calling PrescriptionReceiptEmail, include:
{
  // ... existing fields
  patientPrice: "25.00",  // NEW: Medication price
  oversightFees: [        // NEW: Array of oversight fees
    {
      fee: "50.00",
      reason: "side_effect_monitoring"
    },
    {
      fee: "30.00",
      reason: "dose_titration"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Valid Fee Reasons:**
- `dose_titration`
- `side_effect_monitoring`
- `therapeutic_response`
- `adherence_tracking`
- `contraindication_screening`

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

These were bugs in the previous version that are NOW FIXED:

1. ✅ **Provider lookup** - Now uses `user_id` instead of `provider.id`
2. ✅ **Provider profile required** - Now optional, won't block prescriptions
3. ✅ **Platform admin permissions** - Can now edit any medication
4. ✅ **Dual pricing not saved** - Now properly saves both pricing fields
5. ✅ **Single oversight fee only** - Now supports multiple fees
6. ✅ **Review page incomplete** - Now shows all pricing and fees
7. ✅ **Payment fields required** - Now removed from provider profile
8. ✅ **Medication edit not working** - Now fully functional with save

---

## 📊 DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGES

**New/Modified Fields:**

### `pharmacy_medications` table:
- `notes` field - NOW STORES: `aimrx_site_pricing_cents` (temporary workaround)
- `retail_price_cents` - Pricing to AIMRx (existing, required)

### `prescriptions` table:
- No schema changes, but now stores oversight fees in JSON

**⚠️ NOTE:** We are using the `notes` field to store `aimrx_site_pricing_cents` because adding a new column caused Supabase PostgREST schema cache issues. The database migrations handle this workaround.

---

## 🚨 KNOWN ISSUES & WORKAROUNDS

### Issue 1: Supabase Schema Cache
**Problem:** Adding new column `aimrx_site_pricing_cents` caused schema cache delays

**Workaround:** Storing in `notes` field as string (cents as integer)

**Status:** ✅ Working in development, needs verification in production

**Solution:** After deployment, if you want to use a proper column:
1. Add column in Supabase dashboard
2. Wait 24 hours for cache refresh
3. Run migration to move data from `notes` to new column
4. Update code to use new column

---

### Issue 2: Email Sending
**Problem:** SendGrid API key must be configured

**Status:** ⚠️ VERIFY IN PRODUCTION

**Testing:** Send test prescription email after deployment

---
