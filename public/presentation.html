                <li><strong>Configure dosage forms and strengths:</strong> Each medication can have multiple forms (tablets, capsules, liquid, injection, cream) and strengths (10mg, 25mg, 50mg, etc.). Providers select the exact form and strength when prescribing.</li>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h4>Step 1: Select Patient</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Search existing patients by name or email:</strong> Providers type a patient's name or email into the search box and matching patients appear instantly. Search works across partial names, helping providers find patients quickly even with incomplete information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create new patient inline if not found:</strong> If a patient doesn't exist in the system, providers can create a new patient record right from the prescription wizard without navigating away. Streamlines workflow for first-time patients.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quick access to patient medical history:</strong> Providers can view a patient's previous prescriptions, allergies, conditions, and recent vitals without leaving the wizard. Helps ensure safe prescribing and avoid drug interactions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h4>Step 2: Select Medication</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type-ahead search with instant results:</strong> As providers type medication names, matching drugs appear in real-time with no delay. The search is lightning-fast, searching across 1000+ medications instantly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Filter by category:</strong> When providers don't know the exact medication name, they can browse by therapeutic category like "Antibiotics" or "Pain Management" to see all drugs in that class.</li>
                    <li><strong>View 1000+ medications:</strong> The platform's medication database includes over 1000 commonly prescribed drugs across all therapeutic categories, ensuring providers can prescribe what their patients need.</li>

                <p><strong>Dosage Configuration:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Select dosage form:</strong> Providers choose the medication form most appropriate for the patient - tablets, capsules, liquid suspension, injection, topical cream, inhaler, patches, or suppositories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose strength:</strong> After selecting the form, providers choose the strength (e.g., 10mg, 25mg, 50mg tablets). Strength options are filtered based on the selected form and what's actually available.</li>
                    <li><strong>Set quantity:</strong> Enter how many units to dispense - number of tablets, milliliters of liquid, number of inhalers, etc. Quantity determines how long the medication will last.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enter sig/instructions for patient:</strong> Providers type patient instructions (Sig) like "Take 1 tablet by mouth twice daily with food". These instructions appear on the prescription label and in patient's app.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Payment Method Selection:</strong></p>

                <div class="feature-box">
                    <p><strong>Option 1: Direct Card Entry</strong></p>
