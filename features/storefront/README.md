# Storefront Feature

This feature provides a modern, responsive storefront for general medication and supplement products. It includes:

- Hero section with headline and CTA
- How It Works (3-step process)
- Product highlights (cards for each supplement/medication)
- Customer testimonials
- FAQ section
- Newsletter signup
- Footer with basic links

All data is currently mocked. Intended for frontend development; backend integration will be added later.

## Usage
Import and render the `Storefront` component in your page or route:

```tsx
import { Storefront } from "./features/storefront";

<Storefront />
```
